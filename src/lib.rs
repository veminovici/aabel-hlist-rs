//! # Aabel HList Rust Library
//!
//! A Rust library for working with heterogeneous lists (HLists).
//!
//! This library provides type-safe operations on heterogeneous lists,
//! allowing you to work with lists containing elements of different types
//! while maintaining compile-time type safety.

// Re-export commonly used types and traits
// pub use crate::hlist::*;

// mod hlist;

/// A placeholder module for future HList implementation
pub mod hlist {
    // Heterogeneous list implementation
}
